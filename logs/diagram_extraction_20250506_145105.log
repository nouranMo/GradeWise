To ensure the technicians are using the right tools and equipment, each equipment is saved by a unique code within the system. FFmpeg Platform was used to record, convert, and stream video and audio within the system. The system was also offered to the users both offline and online. Figure 1: Augmented Reality Maintenance Assistant Using YOLOv5 [4] Konstantinidis et al. [5] propose MARMA, an AR-based maintenance assistant. It is a Unity mobile application that has been implemented and tested by maintenance engineers in the au- tomotive industry. This system identifies a component in the user’s environment, and provides visualizations to its maintenance instructions depending on its condition. To build the system, the 5 Vuforia Object Scanner (including the FAST, and SURF algorithms) is utilized for the feature ex- traction and vector creation processes of the machine. In the runtime, the Vuforia natural feature tracking (NFT) method is integrated to identify and track the component of interest throughout the recording process after feature matching using the SURF algorithm. Employing the tiny-YOLOv3 detector, the system locates the area of interest within the camera’s frame during the real-time pro- cess and crops the recorded image. The 3D CAD models are then overlaid on the asset of interest accompanied by a navigable guide of instructions, as shown in Figure 2 Comparing MARMA to paper-based and digital processes, it shortened the overall repair time of a car’s AC compressor by 30%. Figure 2: A Mobile Augmented reality system to assist auto mechanics [5] Ana Cachada et al. [6] proposes a prototype for an AR maintenance application that serves an automotive production unit. The authors acknowledge how maintenance tasks are becoming increasingly complex, due the numerous steps required to be performed with various tools. Thus, Ana Cachada et al. designed the AR application shown in Figures 3 and 4 to make the training and execution processes easier. The application devises an Intelligent Personal Assistant (IPA) to help technicians in performing the maintenance tasks. Also, an Intelligent Decision Support System (IDSS) was utilized to further improve the decision making process during the execution of the maintenance tasks. Prior to the decision making step, Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard is followed to describe the maintenance steps in a graphical notation, and then they are fed into Camunds platform to be converted into XML files. Then, the XML files are processed to be displayed by Unity 3D. Afterwards, Vuforia AR SDK is used to develop the AR marker-based application. The authors then used Microsoft HoloLens and Lenovo 10 Tablet to furnish the application. To validate the application, a System Usability Scale (SUS) Questionnaire was carried and resulted in a score of 84.4 which corresponds to excellent. Ultimately, the authors aim to make the holoLens more immersive, along with supporting voice media to provide more assistance to technicians. 6 Figure 3: AR for Industrial Maintenance [6] Figure 4: AR for Industrial Maintenance [6] 2.2 Business Applications 2.2.1 WorxAR WorxAR [7] is an AR-based application, as shown in Figures 5 and 6, developed by an Australian company called Tradiebot. The application helps technicians by diagnosing any issues, locating and highlighting the parts, and guiding them throughout performing services and repairs. The latest digital schematic diagrams, data sheets, and step by step instructions are overlaid onto the user’s field of view without concealing what they’re working on. They’re also notified about what cannot be modified without compromising the vehicle systems’ safety and integrity. WorxAR also allows users to enter a remote video call with an expert and receive interactive guidance. Virtual quality control check sheets, including capturing images for quality records, are used so that the users can verify the condition and status of the job. It’s made for Phones, Tablets, and Smart Glasses. Figure 5: WorxAR [7] Figure 6: WorxAR [7] 2.2.2 Re’flekt One Re’flekt One [8] is an AR content platform that enables innovative enterprises to create interactive manuals and documentation. It has provided solutions for many leading companies in the market, such as: Bosch The Bosch Common Augmented Reality Platform (CAP) [9], based on the Re’flekt One operating system, targets workshop trainees. It enables them to stay updated with the constantly changing 7 vehicle product lines developments. The system displays for them any new vehicle functionality or information on demand- as shown in Figures 7 and 8, as well as allows them to enlarge and rotate the components in relevance. It’s made available on both Tablets and Smart Glasses (such as the Microsoft HoloLens). Figure 7: Bosch [8] Figure 8: Bosch [8]' mentioned 2 times in 1 sections

This model is trained via Wikitude Studio using a dataset composed of images of different car compo- nents. 8 3.2.3 Instructions request Depending on the user’s choice, the necessary instructions are requested from the cloud Firebase backend. These instructions include text and 3D models with their animation, they guide the user through a certain maintenance procedure or get familiar with a feature. The user has also the option to request remote assistance from a specialist for more advanced maintenance procedures. In this case, a live video call takes place where the professional technician can give instructions throughout the call using their voice or AR annotations through Microsoft’s Dynamics 365 Remote Assist. 3.2.4 AR instructions overlay and object tracking The retrieved instructions are overlaid onto the car components via the Wikitude SDK. Figure 9: System Overview 3.3 System Scope The system shall address the following: • The system shall devise a markerless-based AR system to display detailed instructions for car assistance tasks. 9 • The system shall utilize machine learning models and computer vision techniques for car components detection and recognition. • The system shall overlay the guiding instructions to assist car owners in maintaining their cars and getting acquainted with their cars’ features. • The system shall include procedures that ensures car owners’ safety, that is the system will not incorporate hazardous procedures. • The system shall be able to connect car owners to an expert at the headquarters for assistance. • The system shall offer complementary services for car owners such as finding nearby main- tenance centers. • The system shall be compatible with different hand-held devices. 3.4 System Context The system is built to interact with various external systems in order to achieve its functional and non-functional requirements. As illustrated in figure 10, the application is developed using the Flutter SDK. A connection with a Firebase backend is established for inserting and retrieving the data modeled in section 7.1. Moreover, the Wikitude Studio, SDK, and Encoder provide the needed environment to generate object recognition models, optimize 3D models for low-performance de- vices, and overlay and track objects onto the user’s environment. Furthermore, Microsoft’s Dy- namics 365 Remote Assist shall be integrated to ensure live calls with technicians with the ability to overlay AR annotations. 10 Figure 10: System Context 3.5 Objectives • To develop a user-friendly application that is accessible through mobile devices and tablets to assist average-skilled car owners to easily follow the instructions for their vehicle mainte- nance. • To allow the detection and recognition of the different car parts, whether under-hood com- ponents or car dashboard triggers. • To overlay detailed instructions over the car parts, in the real scene, to perform a task. In- structions can be textual, pictorial, or animated 3D models. 11 • To display warnings to car owners, during a procedure, to prevent them from executing the procedure incorrectly. • To offer a tele-assistance feature for the car owners to get assistance from a remote expert. • To offer complementary car support features to car owners including list of nearby main- tenance centers, reminders for car maintenance procedures, and maintenance checklist for road trips. • To auto-generate detailed report after each car maintenance procedure. 3.6 User Characteristics The system mainly targets car owners to assist them in maintaining their cars and getting ac- quainted with its features. Consequently, the system will also be used by admins and technicians to facilitate the maintenance and feature acquainting procedures onto the car owners. Also, the system is designed to be user-friendly. Howevere, all users must have • basic mobile handling skills e.g connecting to the internet, downloading apps, and signing into a software. • a brief understanding of what AR is and how it works.' mentioned 2 times in 1 sections
