\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a comprehensive study on the evolution of object detection in technical documentation diagrams, specifically focusing on the transition from YOLOv5 to YOLOv8. We demonstrate how the integration of YOLOv8 with OpenCV has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of detecting and analyzing UML diagrams, system context diagrams, and other technical illustrations. Our custom dataset, comprising annotated technical diagrams, was used to train and evaluate both models. The results show that YOLOv8, combined with OpenCV's image processing capabilities, achieves superior performance in detecting diagram components and their relationships, with a notable improvement in precision compared to YOLOv5. This enhancement has proven crucial for automated technical documentation analysis and grading systems.

\section{Introduction}
Technical documentation, particularly Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and Software Design Document (SDD), forms the backbone of software development projects. These documents contain crucial information about system requirements, architecture, and design decisions. The automated analysis of these documents, especially their diagrams, has become increasingly important for ensuring documentation quality and consistency in academic and professional settings.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
Manual review and grading of technical documentation is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Instructors and reviewers face several challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inconsistent evaluation criteria across different reviewers
\item Time-intensive manual inspection of complex diagrams
\item Difficulty in tracking relationships between requirements and design elements
\item Lack of automated tools for comprehensive documentation analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proposed Solution}
Our solution addresses these challenges through an automated technical documentation analysis system that:
\begin{itemize}
\item Employs advanced computer vision techniques using YOLOv8 for diagram detection
\item Integrates OpenCV for enhanced image processing and relationship analysis
\item Provides automated grading and feedback for SRS and SDD documents
\item Ensures consistent evaluation through standardized criteria
\end{itemize}

Our initial implementation using YOLOv5 revealed several challenges in processing technical diagrams. The model struggled with the precise detection of small components and complex relationships between diagram elements. This limitation motivated us to explore YOLOv8, which offered improved architecture and better handling of multi-scale objects. The integration with OpenCV further enhanced our system's capabilities in line detection and relationship analysis.

\section{Related Work}
Previous approaches to diagram analysis have relied heavily on traditional computer vision techniques or simpler deep learning models. Recent advancements in object detection, particularly through the YOLO family of models, have opened new possibilities for technical documentation analysis.

\subsection{Object Detection Evolution}
The YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture has seen significant improvements since its inception. The latest iteration, YOLOv8 by Ultralytics \cite{b1}, brings substantial improvements in detection accuracy and processing efficiency. These advancements make it particularly suitable for detecting complex diagram components in technical documentation.

\subsection{Computer Vision Integration}
OpenCV \cite{b2} remains a cornerstone in computer vision applications, providing robust tools for image processing and analysis. Its integration with modern deep learning models has enabled more sophisticated approaches to diagram analysis. The combination of OpenCV's traditional computer vision capabilities with YOLO's deep learning-based detection has proven particularly effective for technical documentation processing.

\subsection{Educational Applications}
Notable work in the educational domain includes the DUDE (Deep UML DEtector) prototype by Huber and Hagel \cite{b6}. Their research addressed the challenges students face in creating accurate UML class diagrams from textual requirements. The prototype leverages deep learning for visual recognition of UML elements, enabling automated assessment and comparison of student-created diagrams against reference solutions. While their initial experiments with YOLO algorithms revealed some challenges in reliability and detection rates, their work demonstrated the feasibility of providing real-time feedback to students, contributing significantly to the field of automated diagram analysis in educational contexts.

\subsection{Traditional Approaches}
Previous approaches to diagram analysis typically involved:
\begin{itemize}
\item Template matching techniques
\item Rule-based systems
\item Basic edge detection
\item Symbol recognition algorithms
\end{itemize}

These methods often failed to handle:
\begin{itemize}
\item Variations in diagram styles
\item Complex relationships between components
\item Different scales and orientations
\item Noise and distortions in scanned documents
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Project Overview}
Our automated technical documentation analysis system follows a comprehensive pipeline for processing and analyzing SRS and SDD documents. Figure \ref{fig:project_overview} illustrates the high-level architecture of our system:

The system consists of four main components:
\begin{itemize}

We created a custom dataset specifically designed for technical diagram analysis, comprising:
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

The dataset was carefully annotated to include:
\begin{itemize}
